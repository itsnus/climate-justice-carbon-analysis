# climate-justice-carbon-analysis
Data-driven analysis of global CO₂ emissions, climate risk, and inequality using Python

# 🌍 Carbon Emissions & Climate Inequality — A Heated Divide

This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions and their unequal impact on vulnerable countries. Using data from OWID, NASA, and global weather repositories, it answers three core questions:

- **Who emits the most carbon — historically and currently?**
- **Who suffers the most from climate change?**
- **What must be done to ensure climate justice?**

## 📊 Project Highlights

- U.S. leads in historical emissions, China in current totals
- Pakistan and other low-emitting nations face the worst risks
- Per capita data shows massive inequality in individual carbon footprints
- Energy breakdown: coal (China), oil/gas (U.S.)
- Climate risk mapped across heat, pollution, and vulnerability

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `carbon_emission_portfolio_final.ipynb` | Full analysis and visualizations |
| `owid-co2-data.csv` | Emissions by country, fuel type |
| `GLB.Ts+dSST.csv` | Global temperature anomaly data |
| `GlobalWeatherRepository.csv` | Climate & weather data by region |
| `README.md` | This file |

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- Data cleaning, EDA, and time series analysis

## 📌 Key Visualizations

- CO₂ trends (total vs per capita)
- Fuel mix comparison: U.S. vs China
- Temperature anomalies since 1880
- PM2.5 air quality vs climate exposure
- Climate risk index & heat stress maps

## 📣 Conclusion

Climate change isn’t just an environmental crisis — it’s a justice issue.  
This project shows how countries that pollute the least often suffer the most — and what wealthy nations must do to fix that.

## 🔗 Datasets

- [Our World in Data – CO₂ Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)
- [NASA GISTEMP Temperature Data](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
- Additional compiled weather and pollution data
